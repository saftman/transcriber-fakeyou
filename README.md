# Audio Transcription

This is a simple audio transcription program that transcribes WAV files using the Google Speech Recognition API. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting the input folder, output file, and language.

German is 69% Accurate, France/Spanish i didnt tested it.
English is 99% Accurate i will update the code more for more accuracy.
